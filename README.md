Spock
=====

An exploration of the possible strategies for the iterated game described of
guessing numbers described in the
[Art of the Strategy](http://www.artofstrategy.net/1to100.html).

It is named Spock because some of the implemented strategies use bayesian
reasoning and in honor of the recently deceased Leonard Nimoy.

You can try the different strategies by plugging the values defined in the
`Strategy` object in the main function.  Enjoy!
